## Peer Feedback Summary

This section summarizes feedback received from peers during Demo 2 reviews of our Business Dashboard and Email Generation system.

### 1. Dashboard Interface and Structure
- Add a **human-in-the-loop** component to make the system more realistic and allow human verification of AI outputs.  
- Improve **formatting and layout** for better readability and consistent structure.  
- Include **filter or selection buttons** so users can view specific personas, alerts, or email types instead of all at once.  
- Avoid generating results for **all 10 personas** simultaneously to reduce clutter.  
- Simplify or group displayed data to enhance organization and highlight key insights.  
- Several reviewers noted that the dashboard currently shows **too many emails**, making it appear messy. Consider summarizing or categorizing content for clarity.

### 2. Email Generation and Quality 
- Improve the **manual email examples** to make them more realistic and representative of human writing.  
- Ensure email **length and tone are consistent**; manual ones were too short and ai-generated ones were too long.  
- Refine email content for clarity and professionalism.

### 3. Scoring System and Evaluation
- Review and **verify the accuracy of the scoring system** displayed on the dashboard.  
- **Justify the numbers** shown in the demo by explaining how each score is calculated and what it represents.  
- Consider adding short descriptions or tooltips to make the scoring system easier to understand.
