**CFO of Car Company**

Their Situation: 
The ransomware was against their Network, not just their accounting software.  CDK per makes the accounting software.

Unfortunately, they housed the servers for the accounting software vs it being cloud based with a 3rd party.  Hence, they couldn't access it.

Everyone got to work one morning and couldn't get into anything.  All systems down.  thursday, dec 14, 2017

No payments were made to the perpetrators

Systems were down for several days.  Everything was manually done (hand receipts, card deals, all manually written)--that was after a week of zero business, right when their biggest sale of the year happens.

It was 3 1/2 weeks of manual work...that eventually, all had to be manually entered into all of their systems.  They sell a ton of cars so it was very painful to try to do a sale.  Had no financial information since it was all hand written and piling up.

Some files on the internal servers were lost all together.  Many lost files that to this day, have never been recovered.

They, by law, have to scan every car deal and save it in a software system that stores every single piece of paper in a car deal....there are easily 40-50 documents per deal.  They were so back logged as this was the last system to get up and running, that there was a 3 month backlog of scanning once it was up and running.

They also engaged a 3rd party to help with the monitoring and investigation, and luckily, we had cyber insurance and got a large settlement from our insurance co due to the lost revenues and costs incurred during this time. 

Feedback for Experiment:
Dashboard is a bit gamified, try and make it look more realistic and professional for a proper simulation
Need something to hold the AI accountable / grade it. Want it to be measurable to ensure it is working efficiently
All banks are going to have some sort of defense mechanism, would be good to implement something like that again for more realism
Narrow scope, there is a lot going on, potentially too much can take away from the experiment

**BECU Banker**
For our industry stakeholder feedback, we interviewed a BECU banker to get a financial institution’s perspective on our AI agent attack experiment.

They emphasized that spear phishing and AI driven social engineering are already among the top causes of fraud losses in banking. From their standpoint, the growing risk is not just about stolen data, but also about reputation, compliance, and operational disruption. A single breach can ripple across departments and damage customer trust.

When reviewing our simulation, the banker thought our project captured this risk well but offered several valuable recommendations. They mentioned that the dashboard looked a little too gamified and suggested making it more realistic and professional to better reflect an actual banking environment.

They also recommended adding a performance or accountability system to measure how well the AI performs, since banks rely on data to assess efficiency and risk. Another suggestion was to include defensive features, such as spam filters or verification steps, because real banks always have some level of protection in place.

Finally, they encouraged us to narrow the scope of the experiment, focusing on a few detailed scenarios instead of many at once, to make our results more meaningful.

Overall, their feedback validated the importance of our approach and helped us refine our experiment to better mirror the reality of financial institutions.

**Finance & Information System Student**
Overall, they thought the project was well-designed and demonstrated a strong understanding of how AI-generated phishing attacks can be studied in a controlled environment. The narrowed focus on the bank administrator role made the simulation more relevant to real-world financial operations. However, to make it even more realistic, they recommended adding some form of built-in defense mechanism to the system. In actual banking and financial institutions, phishing attempts are constantly met with security measures such as spam filters, automated detection algorithms, or internal reporting systems. Having a simulated defense layer — even a simplified one — would help show not only how effective the phishing attacks are but also how resilient a financial system could be in responding to them.

They also mentioned that including this defensive component would make the experiment more balanced and data-rich. It could, for instance, track detection rates or false positives, offering valuable insights into both offensive and defensive performance. This addition would reflect the dynamic nature of cybersecurity in financial systems, where protection and attack strategies continuously evolve. It would also align the project more closely with how real institutions evaluate system vulnerabilities and response efficiency, giving it a more practical and industry-relevant dimension.

**Quant & Traders**
The stakeholder feedback reinforced that our team is pursuing a meaningful and high-impact direction. They emphasized that the project presents a realistic and technically rigorous exploration of how LLM-powered agents could automate personalized phishing at scale. Stakeholders appreciated the system’s clear structure — from persona-based targeting to the Deception Quality Score framework — and agreed that the experiment highlights important security vulnerabilities in the financial sector. However, they also reminded us that in real enterprise environments, especially within financial institutions, it is difficult for phishing emails to bypass multiple layers of defense such as spam filters, authentication protocols, and endpoint detection systems. Their key recommendation was that we begin exploring potential defense mechanisms alongside offensive testing. Specifically, they encouraged us to model how AI-driven systems could also enhance email defense — for example, adaptive filtering models that detect linguistic patterns of deception or agent-based frameworks that simulate attack–defense interactions. Incorporating this perspective would not only make our project more balanced and ethical but also expand its applicability to cybersecurity research, shifting from demonstrating attack potential to designing proactive defense strategies against LLM-enabled phishing.
