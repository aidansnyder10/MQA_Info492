**CFO of Car Company**

Their Situation: 
The ransomware was against their Network, not just their accounting software.  CDK per makes the accounting software.

Unfortunately, they housed the servers for the accounting software vs it being cloud based with a 3rd party.  Hence, they couldn't access it.

Everyone got to work one morning and couldn't get into anything.  All systems down.  thursday, dec 14, 2017

No payments were made to the perpetrators

Systems were down for several days.  Everything was manually done (hand receipts, card deals, all manually written)--that was after a week of zero business, right when their biggest sale of the year happens.

It was 3 1/2 weeks of manual work...that eventually, all had to be manually entered into all of their systems.  They sell a ton of cars so it was very painful to try to do a sale.  Had no financial information since it was all hand written and piling up.

Some files on the internal servers were lost all together.  Many lost files that to this day, have never been recovered.

They, by law, have to scan every car deal and save it in a software system that stores every single piece of paper in a car deal....there are easily 40-50 documents per deal.  They were so back logged as this was the last system to get up and running, that there was a 3 month backlog of scanning once it was up and running.

They also engaged a 3rd party to help with the monitoring and investigation, and luckily, we had cyber insurance and got a large settlement from our insurance co due to the lost revenues and costs incurred during this time. 

Feedback for Experiment:
Dashboard is a bit gamified, try and make it look more realistic and professional for a proper simulation
Need something to hold the AI accountable / grade it. Want it to be measurable to ensure it is working efficiently
All banks are going to have some sort of defense mechanism, would be good to implement something like that again for more realism
Narrow scope, there is a lot going on, potentially too much can take away from the experiment
